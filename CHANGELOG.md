## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-29

### üéâ Major Rewrite - Universal GPIO Plugin

This is a complete rewrite of the plugin to make it universal and configurable.

### Added
- ‚úÖ **JSON Configuration File** (`gpio_config.json`) for easy customization
- ‚úÖ **Configurable GPIO pins** - no more hardcoded pins
- ‚úÖ **Active LOW / Active HIGH support** - works with any relay board
- ‚úÖ **Custom relay names** - name your devices as you want
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detection** of plugin directory - works with any Domoticz installation
- ‚úÖ **Flexible installation** - just clone to `domoticz/plugins/`
- ‚úÖ **Better error handling** with detailed log messages
- ‚úÖ **Configuration validation** on startup
- ‚úÖ **Support for multiple GPIO chips** (gpiochip0, gpiochip1, etc.)

### Changed
- üîÑ **Plugin name**: "Waveshare Relay Board" ‚Üí "Domoticz RPI GPIO"
- üîÑ **Installation method**: Now uses standard Domoticz plugin installation
- üîÑ **Configuration**: Moved from hardcoded values to JSON file
- üîÑ **Directory structure**: Simplified to `DomoticzRPIGPIO/`
- üîÑ **Documentation**: Complete rewrite with examples and use cases

### Removed
- ‚ùå Hardcoded GPIO pins
- ‚ùå Hardcoded relay logic (active_low only)
- ‚ùå Waveshare-specific naming
- ‚ùå Custom installation script (use standard git clone)
- ‚ùå Hardcoded Domoticz paths

### Technical Details
- Plugin now reads `gpio_config.json` on startup
- Validates configuration before initializing GPIO
- Supports any number of GPIO pins (1-28)
- Works with any relay board (Waveshare, SainSmart, generic, etc.)
- No modification of Domoticz core files needed

### Migration from v1.0.0
If upgrading from v1.0.0:
1. Remove old plugin directory: `rm -rf domoticz/plugins/WaveshareRelayGPIOD`
2. Install v2.0.0: `git clone ... DomoticzRPIGPIO`
3. Configure `gpio_config.json` with your GPIO pins
4. Restart Domoticz

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- Initial release
- Support for Waveshare RPi Relay Board (B)
- Control 8 GPIO relays via libgpiod
- Active LOW logic for relay boards
- Automatic installation script
- GPIO test script
- Complete Slovak documentation
- Debian 13 (Trixie) support
- Domoticz 2025.2+ support

### Technical Details
- Uses modern libgpiod library
